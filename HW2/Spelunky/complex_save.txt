Cave 0 - The Mouth
Harsh wind whistles past your ears as you stare into the dark mouth of the cave.
Cave 1 - Entrance
Bright light flows in from the mouth of the cave, illuminating small rocks.
Cave 2 - Dusk
The cave is still somewhat illuminated, but getting darker.  Not much else is different.
Cave 3 - Chasm
In front of you lies a seemingly bottomless pit.  No light can be seen fron the bottom.
Cave 4 - Rock bottom
You are at the bottom of the pit.  Through your headlamp, many smashed boulders lie around.
Cave 5 - Tunnel
Now in a vey small tunnel.  The smoooth walls seem to press down on you with the weight of the Earth itself.
Cave 6 - The lake
Now in a enourmous cavern, whose center is filled with dark, still water.
Cave 7 - Underwater
Now under the water, the darkness seems to grab hold of you.  Despite your air mask, you feel it suffocate you.
Cave 8 - The Lost Sea
After swimming down even further, dim light eminates through small cracks in the walls.  In the faint light, you can make out the shapes of fish, still and unmoving.
Cave 9 - Up for Air
Ahead, ghostly light drifts down from above.  The fish, still unmoving.
Cave 10 - Air?
Though out of the dark water, wandering through the thick mist of the cave is tough, as if you are still swimming.
Cave 11 - Fields of Mist
The cave has no bounds, and the mist extends as far as you can make out.  In the distance, a bright light drifts out from the distance.
Cave 12 - Into the Light
You moreso feel the light than see it.  There is no sounds here, except the thundering echoe of your footsteps
Cave 13 - Awakening
You blink as if awakening.  The heavanly mist behind you, the ruins ahead of you.
Cave 14 - Ruins
You have finally made it, your journey is over.  The Crown weighs heavily in your fingertips, waiting to be worn.
Cave 15 - The Mouth
Harsh wind whistles past your ears as you stare into the dark mouth of the cave.  You hear The Crown, it's voice both far away, and frighteningly close.
